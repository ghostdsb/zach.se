title: Jaipur

Arrived in Jaipur. Ate breakfast at the ITC buffet. Very good.

Went to guesthouse. Had a profound experience reading the introduction to the Upanishads in the rooftop garden.

Checked into room. Shortly thereafter a group of people my age comes in. Maybe we'll have drinks this evening.

I order an Uber to the market. Walk around the market a bit. Get to the Palace of the Winds. Explore and take pictures.

Walk around a bit more, veering into the side streets. Pass by a group of young children playing on drums. They offer to let me play the drum so I partake. I give them high fives and then they start following me. They ask for money. I leave.

Walk around the market a bit more, ignoring everyone that asks me to enter their store. Then one guy asks me why people are so cold, and I decide to actually engage him in conversation. I explain that the reason that people don't talk to Indian people is because they're worried about getting ripped off, scammed, or deceived. I described the story of me getting ripped off at the train station, and then he offers a similar story about his friend from Thailand. We agree that a few people are ruining things for everyone. The conversation keeps going, we talk about Sweden, he talks about Germany, sharing a funny story about how his friends in Germany have a German Shephard and they took the dog sledding in the snow, and took a funny video of it. We talk about random stuff for a long time and eventually he offers to give me a chair and sit down. He explains it's the Indian custom to offer their guests the opportunity not to stand. I'm kind of nervous about this prospect and tell him I'd rather not, I don't want to go inside the house. However, he tells me we can just hang out outside his shop with his other friend and drink some masala tea. It was a really fun conversation and I learned a lot about Indian culture. They talked about how there's three ways of life in Jaipur, the local way, the touristy way, and the fancy way. I talked about how I was a bad tourist in Agra because I hadn't actually stepped into the Taj Mahal or the fort, which Samir really approved of. I'm starting to feel a lot more comfortable at this point when another guy brings out the tea. For some reason I was really nervous that they were going to poison me, so I start feeling very worried. I'm even more worried when I notice the guy is holding three glasses, one empty stacked underneath a full one in one hand, and a full one in the other hand. He hands both to Samir and Samir hands me the unstacked one. I'm thinking this is their way to know which one is poisoned and which is not. I start having a full-blown panic attack. I start drinking water and while I'm drinking I'm feeling very lightheaded and my mouth is feeling twitchy. They can clearly tell what's going on. I keep drinking the water, and stop drinking the tea. I make up an excuse about how I need to leave, how I meant to meet some people at the hostel for dinner (which isn't entirely untrue). I tell them the reason I seem weird is because I'm late for meeting my friends. They explain that there's nothing to worry about, everything is fine. We carry on the conversation a bit more and they invite me for breakfast the next morning with their family. I accept the invitation which admittedly sounds pretty cool. I'm starting to feel a bit better because I finally manage to get a ride. Then it turns out the driver is Samir's friend and I start feeling worried again. The drive back is in the most intense traffic and I'm feeling pretty lightheaded, possibly because of all the exhaust fumes. We narrowly avoid accidents about 100 times. Eventually we exit the traffic and it looks like Enrique is taking me in the wrong direction. I'm checking google maps and feeling worried. Eventually he finally turns in the right direction and things are good. He tells me he's going to meet me tomorrow at 10 am. When we finally arrive at the guesthouse, he tells me I should run in and check if my friends are there, and if not we can figure something out. I pay him for the ride, run into the guesthouse and realize I've forgotten where my room is located. Luckily I find some people who could tell me where my room is. I go into the room and there's a person sleeping there. Then I run back out and tell him that my friends are here and we're going out to get drinks. That was kind of a lie. He tells me that that's great, then things are going as planned and everything's alright. Then I go back to the room and about 5 minutes later the friends arrive as well, so it wasn't stretching the truth too far. I think that they'll probably end up not going to have drinks with me anyway. I'll probably get some food on my own. Kind of regret letting the guy down, I think he could have showed me an awesome time in Jaipur on a Saturday night. Oh well. Looking forward to tomorrow's breakfast. I don't think I actually got poisoned. It's kind of amazing what the mind can do to the body. Imagine if we learned how to harness this power. Perhaps meditation is the key to this knowledge. I feel like I used to be able to control my emotions in this way, but I've never been able to control physiological responses like this. I've never had a panic attack before, either. This definitely requires further investigation. I wonder if the Upanishads will shed any light on this matter.

* went to cool music shop with classical indian instruments (tabla, sitar, harmonium). played the sitar and the tabla. the shopkeeper gave a cool demonstration. they wanted me to buy something but didn't really pressure me into it.
* had chicken biryani with sameer and shakarh. was hesitant to eat the chicken because it looks like street food. they poured the biryani onto newspapers on the floor and ate it with their hands.
* fitting for the suit and shirts. fit decently well but the material seems cheap. we'll see what happens.
* went to some spice shop. pretty lame, had pictures of celebrities on the wall with the owner. maybe legit, maybe not. was pressured into buying something after the shopkeeper pulled out everything from the cabinets. bought some incense. then they took me into the souvenir store next door. couple white tourists in there. major red flag whenever the only customers are white.
* they're trying to get me to see some guru. i don't believe in that crap and tried to tell them that self-knowledge is only possible to be gained by the self.
* i think that was all for the day. there's not much that happened today. the hike really took the energy out of me.
* got such a bad feeling from these guys today. they violated my trust by repeatedly taking me to these shops where they know the owners.
* sameer unsurprisingly asked for pictures of the receipts from the tailor and carpet store. i doubt it's his family business. on the other hand he played the con so well. maybe it's real, maybe not. i don't know what to believe. on one hand i would feel better if i just assume it was truth, on the other hand if it's not true i've been deceived.

* hostel receptionist thinks i look very tense when i get back and asks if i've been scammed. he explains that i shouldn't get too involved with the locals, and they'll try to befriend you, try to get you to buy jewels and stuff. i tell him it's nothing like that.
