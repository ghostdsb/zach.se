## Overview


### Question

By replacing the 1st digit of *3, it turns out that six of the nine possible 
values: 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83, are all prime.

By replacing the 3rd and 4th digits of 56**3 with the same digit, this 5-digit 
number is the first example having seven primes among the ten generated 
numbers, yielding the family: 56003, 56113, 56333, 56443, 56663, 56773, and 
56993. Consequently 56003, being the first member of this family, is the 
smallest prime with this property.

Find the smallest prime which, by replacing part of the number (not necessarily 
adjacent digits) with the same digit, is part of an eight prime value family.

### Python

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
from itertools import *

    if n==2: return [2]
    elif n<2: return []
    s=range(3,n+1,2)
    mroot = n ** 0.5
    half=(n+1)/2-1
    i=0
    m=3
    while m <= mroot:
        if s[i]:
            j=(m*m-3)/2
            s[j]=0
            while j<half:
                s[j]=0
                j+=m
        i=i+1
        m=2*i+3
    return [2]+[x for x in s if x]

    if n <= 31622:
        i = bisect_left(__primes, n)
        return i != len(__primes) and __primes[i] == n
    # Divide by each known prime
    limit = int(n ** .5)
    for p in __primes:
        if p > limit: return True
        if n % p == 0: return False
    # fall back on trial division if n > 1 billion
    for f in range(31627, limit, 6): # 31627 is the next prime
        if n % f == 0 or n % (f + 4) == 0:
            return False
    return True

def number_families(num):
    digits = [d for d in str(num)]
    products = list(product((True, False), repeat=len(digits)))[1:-1]

        for i, x in enumerate(p):
            if x:
                pattern += digits[i]
            else:
                pattern += 'X'
        yield [int(pattern.replace('X', str(n))) for n in range(10)]

            if len(prime_family) == 8 and prime in prime_family:
