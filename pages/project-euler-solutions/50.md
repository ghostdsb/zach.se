## Overview


### Question

<p>
The prime 41, can be written as the sum of six consecutive primes:
</p>

$$41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13$$

<p>
This is the longest sum of consecutive primes that adds to a prime below one-hundred.
</p>

<p>
The longest sum of consecutive primes below one-thousand that adds to a prime, contains 21 terms, and is equal to 953.
</p>

<p>
Which prime, below one-million, can be written as the sum of the most consecutive primes?
</p>






## Solutions

### Python

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

def euler(n):
    # Create a candidate list within which non-primes will
    # marked as None, noting that only candidates below
    # sqrt(n) need be checked. 
    candidates = range(n+1)
    fin = int(n**0.5)
 
    # Loop over the candidates, marking out each multiple.
    # If the current candidate is already checked off then
    # continue to the next iteration.
    for i in xrange(2, fin+1):
        if not candidates[i]:
            continue
 
        candidates[2*i::i] = [None] * (n//i - 1)
 
    # Filter out non-primes and return the list.
    return [i for i in candidates[2:] if i]

def main():
    primes = euler(1000000)
    largest = 0
    chain = []
    for start in range(10):
        seq = primes[start:]
        i = 0
        total = 0
        for prime in seq:
            total += prime
            if total > 1000000:
                break
            i += 1
            if total in primes:
                c = seq[:i]
                if len(c) > len(chain):
                    chain = c
    print sum(chain)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

$ time pypy consecutive-prime-sum.py

```



### Ruby

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require 'mathn'
primes = Prime.each(10000).to_a
longest = []
primes[0..10].each_with_index { |p, i|
	j = i
	begin
		j += 1
		cons = primes[i..j]
		sum = cons.reduce(:+)
		if sum.prime? && cons.length > longest.length
			longest = cons
		end
	end while sum < 1000000
}
puts longest.reduce(:+)
```


```
$ time ruby consecutive-prime-sum.rb
real	0m0.409s
user	0m0.357s
sys	0m0.015s
```
