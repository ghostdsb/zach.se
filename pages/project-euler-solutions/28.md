## Overview


### Question

Starting with the number 1 and moving to the 
right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral 
is formed as follows:

    21 22 23 24 25
    20  7  8  9 10
    19  6  1  2 11
    18  5  4  3 12
    17 16 15 14 13

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers 
on the diagonals is 101.

What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals 
in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?






## Solutions

### Python

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
def sum_diagonals_of_spiral(size):
    n = 1
    step = 2
    total = 0
    since_last = 0
    while n <= size**2:
        total += n
        n += step
        since_last += 1
        if since_last == 4:
            step += 2
            since_last = 0
    return total

print sum_diagonals_of_spiral(1001)
```


```bash
$ time python2 spiral.py
real   0m0.019s
user   0m0.013s
sys    0m0.003s
```



### Ruby

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
i = 1
sum = i
step = 2
until i >= 1001**2
  4.times { sum += i += step }
  step += 2
end
puts sum
```


```bash
$ time ruby spiral.rb
real   0m0.048s
user   0m0.043s
sys    0m0.003s
```
