## Overview


### Question

Consider the fraction, $\frac{n}{d}$, where $n$ and $d$ are positive
integers. If $n \lt d$ and $\mathrm{HCF}(n,d)=1$, it is called a reduced
proper fraction.

If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for $d \leq 8$ in
ascending order of size, we get:

$$\frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{7}, \frac{1}{6}, \frac{1}{5}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{2}{7}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{3}{8}, \frac{2}{5}, \frac{3}{7}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{4}{7}, \frac{3}{5}, \frac{5}{8}, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{5}{7}, \frac{3}{4}, \frac{4}{5}, \frac{5}{6}, \frac{6}{7}, \frac{7}{8}$$

It can be seen that $\frac{2}{5}$ is the fraction immediately to the
left of $\frac{3}{7}$.

By listing the set of reduced proper fractions for $d \leq 1,000,000$ in
ascending order of size, find the numerator of the fraction immediately
to the left of $\frac{3}{7}$.






## Solutions

### Python

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    three_sevenths = 3.0 / 7
    closest = Fraction(three_sevenths).limit_denominator(1000000)
    while closest == Fraction(3, 7):
        three_sevenths -= 1e-6
        closest = Fraction(three_sevenths).limit_denominator(1000000)
    print closest.numerator

if __name__ == "__main__": main()

```
