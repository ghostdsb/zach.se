## Overview


### Question

It is possible to write five as a sum in exactly six different ways:

$$\begin{aligned}
4 &+ 1 \\
3 &+ 2 \\
3 &+ 1 + 1 \\
2 &+ 2 + 1 \\
2 &+ 1 + 1 + 1 \\
1 &+ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
\end{aligned}$$

How many different ways can one hundred be written as a sum of at least two positive integers?






## Solutions

### Python

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

partitions = {}
def partition(n):
    if n < 0: return 0
    if n == 0: return 1
    if n not in partitions:
        # http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PartitionFunctionP.html
        partitions[n] = sum([(-1)**(k+1) * (partition(n - (k * (3 * k - 1) / 2))
            + partition(n - (k * (3 * k + 1) / 2))) for k in range(1, n+1)])
    return partitions[n]

def main():
    print partition(100) - 1

if __name__ == "__main__": main()
```


```
$ time pypy partitions.py
real	0m0.070s
user	0m0.055s
sys	0m0.015s
