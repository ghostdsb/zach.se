## Overview


### Question

<p>
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two 
terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
</p>

$$1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...$$

<p>
Find the sum of all the even-valued terms in the sequence which do not exceed 
four million.
</p>






## Solutions

### Clojure

```clojure
#!/usr/bin/env clojure
(def fibs (lazy-cat [0 1] (map + (rest fibs) fibs)))
(println (reduce + (filter even? (take-while #(< % 4000000) fibs))))

```


```
$ time clojure fibonacci.clj
real	0m1.030s
user	0m1.557s
sys	0m0.053s
```



### Go

```go
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
	sum := 0
	for a, b := 1, 2; b <= 4e6; a, b = b, a + b {
		if b % 2 == 0 { sum += b }
	}
	fmt.Println(sum)
}

```


```
$ time go run fibonacci.go
real	0m0.257s
user	0m0.207s
sys	0m0.030s
```



### Haskell

```haskell
fibs ::  [Integer]
fibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)

main ::  IO ()
main = print $ sum $ filter even $ takeWhile (<4000000) fibs
```


```
$ time ./fibonacci
real	0m0.002s
user	0m0.000s
sys	0m0.000s
```



### Ruby

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
sum, a, b = 0, 1, 2
while b < 4000000
  sum += b if b.even?
  a, b = b, a + b
end
puts sum
```


```
$ time ruby fibonacci.rb
real	0m0.045s
user	0m0.040s
sys	0m0.003s
```
