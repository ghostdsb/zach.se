## Overview


### Question

Consider the fraction, $\frac{n}{d}$, where $n$ and $d$ are positive
integers. If $n \lt d$ and $\mathrm{HCF}(n,d)=1$, it is called a reduced
proper fraction.

If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for $d \leq 8$ in
ascending order of size, we get:

$$\frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{7}, \frac{1}{6}, \frac{1}{5}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{2}{7}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{3}{8}, \frac{2}{5}, \frac{3}{7}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{4}{7}, \frac{3}{5}, \frac{5}{8}, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{5}{7}, \frac{3}{4}, \frac{4}{5}, \frac{5}{6}, \frac{6}{7}, \frac{7}{8}$$

It can be seen that there are 3 fractions between $\frac{1}{3}$ and
$\frac{1}{2}$.

How many fractions lie between $\frac{1}{3}$ and $\frac{1}{2}$ in the
sorted set of reduced proper fractions for $d \leq 12,000$?






## Solutions

### Python

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
from fractions import gcd

print sum(1 for d in xrange(2, 12001) for n in xrange(1, d) if (n*3 > d) and (n*2 < d) and gcd(n, d) == 1)

```


```
$ time python2 fraction-range.py
real   0m21.239s
user   0m21.187s
sys    0m0.003s
```
