## Overview


### Question

The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:

$$n \rightarrow
\begin{cases} 
\tfrac{n}{2} & \text{if } n \text{ is even} \\\\
3n+1 & \text{if } n \text{ is odd} \\\\
\end{cases}$$

Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:

$$13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1$$

It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains 10 
terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all
starting numbers finish at 1.

Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?

NOTE: Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.






## Solutions

### Python

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
def next_collatz(n):
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return n / 2
    else:
        return 3*n + 1

def collatz(start):
    if start < 1:
        raise ValueError("start must be greater than or equal to 1")
    elif start == 1:
        return [1]

    res = [start]
    done = False
    while not done:
        res += [next_collatz(res[-1])]
        if res[-1] == 1: done = True
    return res

_collatz_cache = {}
def lencollatz(start):
    if start < 1:
        raise ValueError("start must be greater than or equal to 1")
    elif start == 1:
        return 1

    n = start
    length = 1
    done = False
    while not done:
        n = next_collatz(n)
        try:
            length += _collatz_cache[n]
            done = True
        except:
            length += 1
            if n == 1: done = True
    _collatz_cache[start] = length
    return length

max_len = 0
max_i = None
for i in range(1, 1000000):
    l = lencollatz(i)
    if l > max_len:
        max_len = l
        max_i = i
print max_i
```


```
$ time python2 longest-chain.py
real	0m1.467s
user	0m1.339s
sys	0m0.102s
```



### Ruby

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

max_l = 0
max_i = 0
500001.step(1000000, 2).each do |i|
	l = 0
	j = i
	while j != 1 do
		if j.even?
			j /= 2
		else
			j = 3 * j + 1
		end
		l += 1
	end
	if l > max_l
		max_l = l
		max_i = i
	end
end

puts max_i
```


```
$ time ruby longest-chain.rb
real	0m5.114s
user	0m5.095s
sys	0m0.008s
```
