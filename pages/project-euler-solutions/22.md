## Overview


### Question

Using names.txt,
a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names, 
begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working 
out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this 
value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain 
a name score.

For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, 
COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th 
name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of 
938 * 53 = 49714.

What is the total of all the name scores in the file?






## Solutions

### Python

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
import os
from string import ascii_uppercase

def calculate_score(name, index):
    alpha_score = sum(ascii_uppercase.index(letter)+1 for letter in name)
    return index * alpha_score

def main():
    names_file = open(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'names.txt'))
    names_string = names_file.read()
    names = [name.strip('"') for name in names_string.split(',')] 
    names.sort()
    print sum(calculate_score(name, index+1) for index, name in enumerate(names))
    names_file.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```


```
$ time pypy names.py
real	0m0.464s
user	0m0.083s
sys	0m0.020s
```



### Ruby

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

names = File.open(File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/names.txt').read.scan(/\w+/).sort
puts names.map { |name| 
	word_score = name.each_byte.map { |c| c - 64 }.reduce(:+)
	(names.index(name) + 1) * word_score
}.reduce(:+)
```


```
$ time ruby names.rb
real	0m1.163s
user	0m1.131s
sys	0m0.009s
```
