## Overview


### Question

The number, 197, is called a circular prime because all rotations of the digits: 197, 971, and 719, are themselves prime.

There are thirteen such primes below 100: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, and 97.

How many circular primes are there below one million?






## Solutions

### Ruby

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require 'mathn'
puts (1..1000000).select { |i|
	(1..i.to_s.length).all? { |j|
		i.to_s.split('').rotate(j).join('').to_i.prime?
	}
}.count
```


```
$ time ruby circular-primes.rb
real	0m53.811s
user	0m53.678s
sys	0m0.015s
```
