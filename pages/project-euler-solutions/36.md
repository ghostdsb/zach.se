## Overview


### Question

<p>
The decimal number, $585 = 1001001001_2$ (binary), is palindromic in both bases.
</p>

<p>
Find the sum of all numbers, less than one million, which are palindromic in base 10 and base 2.
</p>

<p>
(Please note that the palindromic number, in either base, may not include leading zeros.)
</p>






## Solutions

### Clojure

```clojure
#!/usr/bin/env clojure
(defn reversed [string]
  (apply str (reverse string)))

(defn palindrome? [string]
  (= string (reversed string)))

(defn palindrome-in-decimal-and-binary? [n]
  (and (palindrome? (Integer/toString n 2))
       (palindrome? (Integer/toString n))))

(println (reduce + (filter palindrome-in-decimal-and-binary? (range 1 1000000))))
```


```
$ time clojure palindromic-bases.clj
real	0m6.195s
user	0m7.200s
sys	0m0.273s
```



### Ruby

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
class String
	def palindrome?
		self == self.reverse
	end
end

puts (1..1000000).select { |i| i.to_s.palindrome? && i.to_s(2).palindrome? }.reduce(:+)
```


```
$ time ruby binary-palindrome.rb
real	0m0.694s
user	0m0.658s
sys	0m0.005s
```
