## Overview


### Question

<p>
The cube, $41063625$ ($345^3$), can be permuted to produce two other cubes: $56623104$ ($384^3$) and $66430125$ ($405^3$). 
In fact, $41063625$ is the smallest cube which has exactly three permutations of its digits which are also cube.
</p>

<p>
Find the smallest cube for which exactly five permutations of its digits are cube.
</p>






## Solutions

### Python

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
from collections import defaultdict
def cube(x): return x**3

def main():
    cubes = defaultdict(list)
    for i in range(10000):
        c = cube(i)
        digits = ''.join(sorted([d for d in str(c)]))
        cubes[digits].append(c)
    print min([min(v) for k, v in cubes.items() if len(v) == 5])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```


```bash
$ time python2 cube-permutations.py
real   0m0.100s
user   0m0.090s
sys    0m0.007s
