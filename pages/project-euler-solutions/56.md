## Overview


### Question

A googol ($10^{100}$) is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred
zeros; $100^{100}$ is almost unimaginably large: one followed by
two-hundred zeros. Despite their size, the sum of the digits in each
number is only 1.

Considering natural numbers of the form, $ab$, where $a, b < 100$, what
is the maximum digital sum?






## Solutions

### Python

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
from itertools import *

def get_digits(n):
    return [int(digit) for digit in str(n)]

def main():
    largest = 0
    for a, b in product(range(1, 100), range(1, 100)):
        s = sum(get_digits(a ** b))
        if s > largest:
            largest = s
    print largest

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```


```bash
$ time python2 digital-sum.py
real   0m0.390s
user   0m0.387s
sys    0m0.003s
```
