## Overview


### Question

A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is
exactly equal to the number. For example, the sum of the proper divisors
of 28 would be 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, which means that 28 is a perfect
number.

A number n is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less
than n and it is called abundant if this sum exceeds n.

As 12 is the smallest abundant number, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, the
smallest number that can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers
is 24. By mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers
greater than 28123 can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers.
However, this upper limit cannot be reduced any further by analysis even
though it is known that the greatest number that cannot be expressed as
the sum of two abundant numbers is less than this limit.

Find the sum of all the positive integers which cannot be written as the
sum of two abundant numbers.

### Python

```python

        raise ValueError('fact() argument should be >= 1')

        return []  # special case
    res = []
    # iterate over all even numbers first.
    while n % 2 == 0:
        res.append(2)
        n //= 2
    # try odd numbers up to sqrt(n)
    limit = math.sqrt(n+1)

    while i <= limit:
        if n % i == 0:
            res.append(i)

            limit = math.sqrt(n+i)
        else:

    factors = sorted(res)
    histogram = defaultdict(int)
    for factor in factors:
        histogram[factor] += 1

    return list(histogram.items())

            if f[i] <= factors[i][1]:
                break
            f[i] = 0
            i += 1
            if i >= nfactors:
                return

def proper_divisors(n):
    return list(divisors(n))[:-1]

    total = sum(proper_divisors(n))
    if total == n:
        # perfect
        return 0
    elif total > n:
        # abundant
        return 1
    else:
        # deficient
        return -1

def main():
    abundant = set(number for number in range(2, 30000) if classify(number) == 1)
    sums = sorted(set(sum(c) for c in combinations_with_replacement(abundant, 2)))
    print(sum(number for number in range(1,30000) if number not in sums))

### Ruby

```ruby

		primes, powers = self.prime_division.transpose 
		exponents = powers.map{|i| (0..i).to_a} 
		divisors = exponents.shift.product(*exponents).map do |powers| 
			primes.zip(powers).map{|prime, power| prime ** power}.inject(:*) 
		end 
		divisors.take divisors.length - 1
	end

	def abundant?
		self.divisors.reduce(:+) > self
	end
end

abundants = (1..28213).select { |n| n.abundant? }
i = 0
sums = []
abundants.each do |x|
	abundants[i..abundants.length].each do |y|
		sum = x + y
		sums << sum unless sum > 28213
