## Overview


### Question

The primes 3, 7, 109, and 673, are quite remarkable. By taking any two
primes and concatenating them in any order the result will always be
prime. For example, taking 7 and 109, both 7109 and 1097 are prime. The
sum of these four primes, 792, represents the lowest sum for a set of
four primes with this property.

Find the lowest sum for a set of five primes for which any two primes
concatenate to produce another prime.







## Solutions

### Haskell

```haskell
primes :: [Int]
primes = 2 : sieve primes [3,5..] where
    sieve (p:ps) xs = h ++ sieve ps [x | x <- t, rem x p /= 0]
                      where (h, t) = span (< p*p) xs

isPrime :: Int -> Bool
isPrime n | n < 1 = False
          | otherwise = not $ or [n `rem` x == 0 | x <- [2..floor $ sqrt $ fromIntegral n]]

allPrime :: [Int] -> Bool
allPrime ps = all isPrime [read ((show a) ++ (show b)) | a <- ps, b <- ps, a /= b]

filterPairs :: Int -> [Int] -> [Int]
filterPairs p = filter test where
    test x = isPrime (read $ show x ++ show p) && isPrime (read $ show p ++ show x)

candidates :: [[Int]]
candidates = filter allPrime [[a, b, c, d, e] | a <- primes',
                                                let bs = filterPairs a $ dropWhile (<= a) primes',
                                                b <- bs,
                                                let cs = filterPairs b $ dropWhile (<= b) bs,
                                                c <- cs,
                                                let ds = filterPairs c $ dropWhile (<= c) cs,
                                                d <- ds,
                                                let es = filterPairs c $ dropWhile (<= d) ds,
                                                e <- es]
    where primes' = takeWhile (< 10000) primes

main :: IO ()
main = print $ sum $ head candidates
```


```bash
$ ghc -O2 -o prime-pairs prime-pairs.hs
$ time ./prime-pairs
real   0m0.483s
user   0m0.480s
sys    0m0.000s
```
