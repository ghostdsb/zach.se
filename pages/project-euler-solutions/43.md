## Overview


### Question

The number, 1406357289, is a 0 to 9 pandigital number because it is made
up of each of the digits 0 to 9 in some order, but it also has a rather
interesting sub-string divisibility property.

Let $d_1$ be the $1^{st}$ digit, $d_2$ be the $2^{nd}$ digit, and so on.
In this way, we note the following:

$$\begin{aligned}
d_2d_3d_4 & =406 \text{ is divisible by 2} \\
d_3d_4d_5 & =063 \text{ is divisible by 3} \\
d_4d_5d_6 & =635 \text{ is divisible by 5} \\
d_5d_6d_7 & =357 \text{ is divisible by 7} \\
d_6d_7d_8 & =572 \text{ is divisible by 11} \\
d_7d_8d_9 & =728 \text{ is divisible by 13} \\
d_8d_9d_{10} & =289 \text{ is divisible by 17}
\end{aligned}$$

Find the sum of all 0 to 9 pandigital numbers with this property.






## Solutions

### Python

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
from itertools import *

def has_property(digits):
    primes = [1,2,3,5,7,11,13,17]
    for i in range(1, len(digits)-2):
        if not int(''.join(digits[i:i+3])) % primes[i] == 0:
            return False
    return True 

def convert_list_to_int(l):
    return int(''.join(str(i) for i in l))

def main():
    pandigitals = permutations((str(i) for i in range(10)))
    print sum(convert_list_to_int(p) for p in pandigitals if has_property(p))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```


```
$ time python2 pandigital-substrings.py
real   0m8.061s
user   0m8.053s
sys    0m0.010s
```



### Ruby

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
primes = [1,2,3,5,7,11,13,17]
puts ('0'..'9').to_a.permutation.select { |digits| 
  (1..7).all? { |i|
    digits[i..i+2].join('').to_i % primes[i] == 0
  }
}.map { |digits| digits.join('').to_i }.reduce(:+)
```


```
$ time ruby pandigital-substrings.rb
real   0m9.171s
user   0m9.167s
sys    0m0.007s
```
